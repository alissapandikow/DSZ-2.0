# Post-Quantum signatures zoo 2.0

Welcome to the Post-Quantum Signatures Zoo 2.0, where we provide an extensive overview of the post-quantum algorithms submitted to the NIST post-quantum signatures initiative, both on-ramp and finalists.

The original source code for this project comes from pqshield/nist-sigs-zoo. I have built additional pages, improvements, and extensions to enhance the functionality of the website.

Our goal is to continuously improve and expand the project, eventually including key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and other types of post-quantum cryptographic schemes. We appreciate any contributions, especially from those with web development expertise, to help make this project even better. Thank you for your support and contributions to this evolving project.
